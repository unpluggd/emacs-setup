My Emacs Setup
==============

This is the emacs set-up I use across various machines, which are usually macs. 
I do have a putty-based config enabled for those times I need to work on a 
windows machine.

Feel free to use in full or copy any parts of my config. Suggestions and 
improvements welcome!
